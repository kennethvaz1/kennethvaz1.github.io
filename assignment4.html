            In my breadboard I used two 220 ohm resistors to balance the load of an (LED strip) and be operated with my photoresistor. In hindsight I should have used 10k ohm resistors to more safely prevent excessive current from being drawn from my arduino pin.

            My program prints the sensor and output values to the serial monitor!

            I connected Pin 9 of my Arduino to a 220 ohm resistor and then to a transistor which was connected to the LED strip on one side and to ground and the 9V battery on the other. Similarly Pin A0 is connected to a 220 ohm resistor leading to ground and 9V on side and to a photoresitor and 5V on the other. This schematic safely allows the transistor to ampfliy the current of the LED strip, while having the resistors balance out the load.

                This GIF shows how the light effects the load (LED strips) in my circuit. When I cover the light around my photoresistor, my LED is signaled to turn down its brightness!
